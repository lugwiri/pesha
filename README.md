# pesha 
pesha is basically a platform  about users uploading eBooks and videos (podcasts). But the uploads must be approved before appearing in user/newsfeeds. The feeds are like the facebook feeds. Each feed should have the username (their real name), their profile pic the upload, a short description about the contents, and a subscription button and a download buttons. To read/download an ebook or watch a video, a user must subscribe to that author. Once subscribed, the user can read all ebooks/videos associated with that authos for free for 12 months before renewing their subscription. To subscribe, users must buy bundles representing tokens. Ebook subscriptions costs 200 tokens while video subscriptions cost 300 tokens. Bundles range from 100-2000. 100 bundles costs 1$ and each 100 bundles has 100 tokens.Payments can be through mobile money, paypal, credit etc

Users who upload also earn tokens per upload i.e for eBooks, they earn 100 tokens & 150 tokens for videos
They also earn per subscription i.e 20 tokens for each eBook subscription & 30 tokens for each podcast subscription. These tokens are added to their bundle balance and they can use for uploads or subscribe to other users. They can also sale the earned tokens to other users./users who subcribe to others also earn tokens, 20 tokens for eBook subscription, 30 tokens for podcast subscription. These are added to their bundles. They can use the tokens to subscribe, uploads, or even sale them to others

Users can also offer their reviews of the work they read/watch (),comments, or share the feeds with others. 
Anyone can join the platform and subscribe to any user but anyone wishing to upload must have 1000 tokens for ebooks and 1500 tokens for podcasts (videos) i.e the costs of the uploads.

Once subscribed, users can download the file, which should be saved in the library folder for offline use later. The library should have a reader for .pdf, .epub, .chm files and support video watching in offline mode.
Once registered, users can form book reading clubs/podcast watching clubs (like facebook groups).

Users will also have their personal accounts where they can view their subscriptions, the subscribers to their work, their uploads and everything associated with them.
Users can also create book clubs or podcast clubs for reading books or watching podcasts 
The admin should be able to access all functions such as reviewing user works, deleting accounts etc.

Processed uploads will appear in a newsfeed (will be like posts with a download and a subscribe buttons)
Each post will also have a review section (comments) and a share button
